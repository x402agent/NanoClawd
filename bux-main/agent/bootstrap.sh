# system prompt as claude. Boxes provisioned BEFORE that line landed in
# install.sh end up with no AGENTS.md, leaving codex with no operating
# manual at runtime. Re-assert here on every update so existing boxes
# self-heal. Idempotent: -f forces replacement if a stale entry exists,
# -n keeps it from de-referencing through an existing symlink directory.

# --- agency skill stub for Claude Code -------------------------------------
# Claude Code auto-loads skills from ~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md and

# canonical doctrine lives in agent/AGENCY.md; agent/agency-skill.md is a
# thin stub that just owns the trigger phrases ("start agency", "scan
# everything", etc.) and points back at AGENCY.md. We symlink the stub
# into place so a `git pull` to a newer AGENCY.md propagates without
# re-running bootstrap, and so the stub itself stays under version
# control instead of drifting on-disk per-box.

# agency-report invocation can init the schema without sudo.

# --- Cloud Composio MCP server (cloud-side proxy) -------------------------
# Why MCP at all: cloud holds the platform's Composio API key plus every
# integration the user OAuth'd via cloud.browser-use.com. Rather than
# duplicating that ceremony on each box (Composio key, per-toolkit auth
# configs, OAuth callbacks, refresh-token storage), we point Claude Code
# at a cloud-hosted MCP endpoint that proxies tool calls through with the
# box's project_id as the Composio entity_id. Net effect: any toolkit the
# user has connected on cloud (Gmail, Calendar, Slack, …) is automatically
# available to the box agent as native tools — zero per-box setup.
#
# Token rotation: BUX_BOX_TOKEN gets baked into ~/.claude.json by
# `claude mcp add` at registration time. If the cloud rotates the token,
# the next /update re-runs this section, which removes + re-adds the MCP
# server with the fresh token. Manual rotation: re-run bootstrap.sh.
#
# To disable: as the bux user, `claude mcp remove composio`. The next
# /update will re-add it unless this section is removed too.

  # Idempotent: remove any prior entry (ignore failure if it didn't exist),
  # then re-add against the current token. -H so HOME resolves to /home/bux
  # and the registration lands in bux's ~/.claude.json, not root's.
  #
  # `--scope user` is critical: without it, `claude mcp add` defaults to
  # `--scope local`, which writes the MCP entry under the *current working
  # directory's* project record in ~/.claude.json. bootstrap.sh's CWD
  # depends on who invoked it (cloud-init runs us from /, packer from
  # /opt/bux/repo, /update from /home/bux), so the MCP would land in a
  # random project entry the bot's claude session never visits. The bot
  # always runs claude from /home/bux (see CLAUDE.md), so a registration
  # under e.g. `projects./opt/bux/repo` is dead weight — `claude mcp list`
  # from /home/bux returns nothing for composio. User-scope is project-
  # independent and matches the "available to every claude session as bux"
  # intent. The `claude mcp remove` call above doesn't take --scope, so it
  # finds and clears the entry regardless of which scope it was previously
  # written to (handles the cleanup of the old buggy local-scope entries).

# --- git safe.directory so root tools can read the bux-owned repo --------
# /opt/bux/repo is owned by bux. When telegram_bot.py (User=root) shells
